--- Building cow_client in Windows ---

1. Open the command prompt and change directory to the cow_client root directory.

2. The CMake script will use environmental variables to locate libraries. Set appropriate paths, for example:
    
    set BOOST_ROOT=C:\boost_1_42_0
    set LIBTORRENT_ROOT=C:\path\to\libtorrent
    set LIBTORRENT_LIB=C:\path\to\libtorrent\lib\files\directory
    
LIBTORRENT_LIB is the path where the .lib and .dll files of libtorrent are found.
    
3. Create a build directory:

    mkdir build

4. Run cmake:

    cmake ..
    
5. Now, open the solution file build/COW_CLIENT.sln in Visual Studio and build.
